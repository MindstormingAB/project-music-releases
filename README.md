# Music Releases

This project was the first time using React and was based on pair programming; I collaborated with [Jessica Panditha](https://github.com/jespa374). 
The aim was to create a music site displaying images of albums and the album and the artist and use data from an API to display all this information. The focus was components and props and how to structure a website using components and passing in props to these components.

## The problem

First the structure of the website was decided by breaking different parts of the website into small blocks for example header, releaselist etc) and make them components. After that the data was retrieved and mapped in order to pass in to the different HTML elements. Then different hover effects were done for each item such as image, button icons etc. CSS Grid was used to align the releases and achieve responsiveness as required.

We even achieved the red level by replacing ',' by '&' between the second-to-last and last artist in case of multiple artists and increase the opacity of the play button when hovering.

If there was more time we would have worked on the black level goals too.
